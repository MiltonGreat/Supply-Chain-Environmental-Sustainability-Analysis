# SQL Supply Chain Management and Environmental Sustainability Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes supply chain data with a particular focus on energy consumption, carbon emissions, renewable energy use, and environmental impact among companies. The goal is to assess the environmental sustainability practices within supply chains and evaluate how they correlate with key business metrics, such as customer satisfaction and supply chain agility. By investigating the environmental impact and green logistics of companies, this analysis provides insights into sustainability efforts and opportunities for improvement in supply chain operations.

### Objectives

- **Energy Consumption Analysis**: Identify companies with the highest energy consumption and uncover potential inefficiencies or opportunities for improvement.
- **Carbon Emissions**: Analyze the relationship between carbon emissions and energy use, and how the use of renewable energy influences overall emissions.
- **Environmental Impact Scores**: Identify companies with the highest environmental impact scores to target areas for sustainability improvements.
- **Use of Renewable Energy**: Examine how companies incorporate renewable energy and its relationship with carbon emissions.
- **Customer Satisfaction and Supply Chain Agility**: Investigate the correlation between customer satisfaction and supply chain agility. A more agile supply chain could lead to better customer satisfaction by responding faster to market demands.

### Dataset Description

The dataset titled "SCM Dataset with Green Logistics" comprises a comprehensive collection of data from various companies, focusing on their supply chain management (SCM) practices, performance metrics, and green logistics initiatives. Key features of the dataset include:

- **SCM Practices**: Information on various supply chain management practices, such as Agile SCM, Lean Manufacturing, and Cross-Docking.
- **Performance Metrics**: Quantitative metrics like Supplier Count, Inventory Turnover Ratio, Lead Time (days), Order Fulfillment Rate (%), and Customer Satisfaction (%).
- **Technology Utilized**: Details on technologies used by companies, such as ERP, AI, Robotics, and Blockchain.
- **Environmental Impact Metrics**: Data on carbon emissions (kg CO2e), recycling rates (%), energy consumption (MWh), use of renewable energy (%), and green packaging usage (%).
- **Sustainability Indicators**: Environmental Impact Score, Supply Chain Agility, Sustainability Practices, and Supply Chain Complexity Index.
- **Financial Metrics**: Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), Operational Efficiency Score, Revenue Growth Rate, and Supply Chain Risk (%).
- **Collaborative Metrics**: Supplier Collaboration Level, Supply Chain Resilience Score, and Supplier Relationship Score.

The dataset allows for a comprehensive analysis of how companies' supply chain practices impact both operational efficiency and environmental sustainability.

### Key Analysis
1. **Energy Consumption and Carbon Emissions**
- Identified the companies with the highest energy consumption and examined the relationship between energy use and carbon emissions.
- Explored how the integration of renewable energy sources affects overall carbon emissions.

2. **Environmental Impact Scores**
- Ranked companies based on their environmental impact scores, taking into account factors such as carbon emissions, energy consumption, and sustainability practices.

3. **Renewable Energy Use**
- Analyzed the role of renewable energy in reducing carbon footprints and its correlation with other sustainability metrics.

4. **Customer Satisfaction and Supply Chain Agility**
- Investigated how supply chain agility influences customer satisfaction, particularly focusing on companies with high supply chain agility and their corresponding satisfaction scores.

### Results and Insights

- **Top Companies with the Highest Energy Consumption**: Facebook, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
- **Companies with Low Carbon Emissions and High Green Packaging Usage**: No companies met both criteria, indicating an opportunity for improvement in this area.
- **High Environmental Impact**: Companies such as Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, Google, and Amazon ranked highest in terms of environmental impact, despite varying green logistics practices.
- **Customer Satisfaction vs. Supply Chain Agility**: Companies with high supply chain agility, such as Google and Amazon, typically achieved higher customer satisfaction scores.
