    "This project analyzes supply chain data, particularly focusing on energy consumption, carbon emissions, renewable energy use, and environmental impact among companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is likely aimed at analyzing the environmental sustainability of companies within a supply chain context. This could involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Energy Consumption Analysis**: Identifying the companies with the highest energy consumption (in MWh), which is a key factor in understanding a company’s environmental footprint. The project is aimed at identifying which companies are using the most energy, potentially leading to insights about energy inefficiencies or opportunities for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Carbon Emissions**: Analyzing the relationship between carbon emissions and energy use, especially looking into how companies’ use of renewable energy might influence their overall carbon emissions. This can help identify companies that are more eco-friendly or those that need to take steps to reduce their carbon footprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Environmental Impact Scores**: Focusing on environmental impact scores (i.e., companies with the highest environmental impact), which is a key measure of sustainability efforts. These scores may take into account factors like energy consumption, carbon emissions, and other environmental concerns, and identifying companies with the highest impact can help target areas for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use of Renewable Energy**: Exploring how companies are using renewable energy and its relationship with their carbon emissions. This is crucial for assessing whether companies are integrating more sustainable energy sources into their operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Customer Satisfaction and Supply Chain Agility**: Investigating how customer satisfaction correlates with supply chain agility (i.e., how quickly and efficiently a company can adapt its supply chain to changes). A more agile supply chain could potentially lead to better customer satisfaction by responding faster to market demands."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project analyzes and evaluates the supply chain management practices and sustainability efforts of top companies in the tech industry, focusing on their energy consumption, carbon emissions, use of renewable energy, green packaging, and overall environmental impact. Additionally, we examined the relationship between supply chain agility, customer satisfaction, and advanced technologies (such as AI, blockchain, and robotics). The findings offer valuable insights for businesses looking to improve their environmental impact and operational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Supply Chain Practices**:\n",
    "- Most companies in the dataset employ agile or lean supply chain practices, with Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook all utilizing these methods. These practices are known for enhancing supply chain flexibility, improving response times, and potentially boosting customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Customer Satisfaction and Lead Time**:\n",
    "- There is a negative correlation (-0.4326) between lead time and customer satisfaction, suggesting that shorter lead times generally lead to higher customer satisfaction. Companies with very fast lead times (≤5 days) had high customer satisfaction, such as Google and Apple.\n",
    "- Companies with moderate lead times (11-15 days) still maintained high levels of customer satisfaction, indicating that fast fulfillment may not always be the only factor influencing customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use of Advanced Technologies**:\n",
    "- Leading companies like Amazon, Apple, and Facebook utilize advanced technologies such as ERP, AI, blockchain, and robotics, contributing to their agile supply chain practices. These technologies improve operational efficiency and enable smarter decision-making in managing inventory and fulfillment.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Environmental Impact and Sustainability**:\n",
    "- The carbon emissions data reveals that Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Facebook all produce significant carbon emissions, with Facebook having the highest emissions. However, all these companies are actively integrating renewable energy into their operations, though their carbon emissions remain high.\n",
    "- The green packaging usage is relatively modest across the companies, with Apple and Microsoft showing slightly better results than the others.\n",
    "- Despite these efforts, the project could not identify companies with both low carbon emissions and high green packaging usage, suggesting that further efforts are needed to balance these two environmental aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Sustainability Rankings**:\n",
    "- Companies were ranked based on their sustainability scores, which integrate factors like carbon emissions, green packaging usage, and environmental impact scores. All companies in the dataset scored similarly (0.60), indicating that while they have made strides toward sustainability, there is still room for significant improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Energy Consumption**:\n",
    "- Facebook has the highest energy consumption among the top companies, followed closely by Amazon and Google. These companies consume substantial amounts of energy, which suggests an area where they could improve energy efficiency and further reduce their environmental footprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Environmental Impact Scores**:\n",
    "- Companies like Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, and Google have relatively high environmental impact scores, which indicate that while they are taking some steps toward sustainability, their overall impact remains substantial. This highlights the need for continued innovation in reducing carbon emissions and enhancing sustainable practices across their operations."

    "### Why is this Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Environmental Sustainability**: The focus on energy consumption, carbon emissions, and renewable energy is critical for companies aiming to meet global sustainability goals, especially in light of climate change. Companies with a high environmental impact or inefficient energy use can benefit from insights that guide them to become more sustainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Corporate Responsibility**: Analyzing environmental scores and carbon footprints can help businesses make informed decisions about improving their sustainability practices, thus enhancing their reputation and meeting regulations related to climate action.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Supply Chain Performance**: By looking at supply chain agility and customer satisfaction, this project can help businesses improve efficiency and responsiveness, which could lead to both better business performance and customer loyalty."
